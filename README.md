# visual-artist-portfolio - work in progress

## Project structure clarification

### HTML

The website consists of:

- index.html

- three "artwork" pages - these were given generic names for some flexibility in order to avoid too excessive website restructuring and refactoring as the content changes

- a contact page 

### SCSS

- index.scss contains styling for the whole website

### JavaScript

- ham-navigation.js is reused on all pages

- three "artwork" scripts for each artwork page (again, generic names were given for flexibility) as each of them uses a different portion of data.json via fetch(url)

### JSON

All artwork data organized.
