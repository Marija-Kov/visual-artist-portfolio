The charred substance composed out of burnt animal body parts (byproducts of the food industry) and plants stand as the essentialist response to the illusionist ideas about existence, primarily that of humans and their consciousness - a cultural tendency that transcends the mere fight for survival and that might just be the one which makes humans the most invasive species on the planet. The project is a particularly uncharismatic allusion to the distant future."
