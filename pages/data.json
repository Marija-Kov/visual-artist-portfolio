         "description": "The concept was inspired by the lyrics of Joni Mitchell in the context of preservation of the life on Earth. The charred substance composed out of burnt animal body parts (byproducts of the food industry) and plants stand as the essentialist response to the illusionist ideas about existence, primarily that of humans and their consciousness - a cultural tendency that transcends the mere fight for survival and that might just be the one which makes humans the most invasive species on the planet. The project is a particularly uncharismatic allusion to the distant future."

The material simplicity that is turned into a rich variety of forms and textures - that are unique to this technique - at the same time reminds of the challenge of scarcity and inacessibility of the resources and the growing need to make more out of less with inventive solutions."
